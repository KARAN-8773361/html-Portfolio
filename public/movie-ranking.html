<h2>My Top 3 Movies/shows of 2024</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Substance</h3>
<p>
  It is a really good movie it may not be appropriate for some viewers bcoz of
  it's goreness but the idea of the movie is wonderful
</p>

<h3>Better Call Saul</h3>
<p>
  It's spinoff of breaking bad and it's fabulous like it vince gilligan is a
  genius
</p>

<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3>
<p>
  Ending is not what I expected like everyone but it's always about the journey
  not the destination
</p>
